# Snoop
Repository demonstrating API hashing with a pythonic hashing program that takes the string value of the API you want to hash as input. Refactored version of ired.team's C++ code for an example of implementation, snoop is a Python port of their hashing algorithm as well.

This is a learning POC! All credit to the author(s) of the blog's that fueled this project:
