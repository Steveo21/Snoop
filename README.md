# Snoop
Repository demonstrating API hashing with a pythonic hashing program that takes the string value of the API you want to hash as input. Refactored version of cocomelonc's CXX implementation of getprocaddress and getmodulehandle is used as an example of how to implement snoop into a C program.

This is a learning POC! All credit to the author(s) of the blog's that fueled this project:
